In order to reproduce a simulation study one can use files simulaMod8.m and simulaMod12.m

The main functions are EMparsmix.m and EMparsmixs.m for fitting the models 1-8 and 9-12, 
described in tables 1 and 2 of the papaer, respectively.

In summary models 1-8 are the following ones: CCC, CCU, CUC, CUU, UCC, UCU, UUC, UUU.
Models, 9-12 are: (SC)CC, (SC)CU, (SC)UC, (SC)UU.

The files shall be run in MatLab.
